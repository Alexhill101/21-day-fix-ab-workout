How to – 

Place your hands behind your head and lie down on your back. 
Elevate your shoulders off the mat, raise your legs to a 90-degree bend, and gaze towards your thighs while keeping your neck relaxed. 
This is the point from which you will begin your journey. 

Engage the abs and rotate the right elbow toward the left knee while straightening the right leg and lowering it as near to the floor as possible without resting it on the mat.

Rep on the other side and 10 reps are required. Proceed to the following step.

 

Side plank


Begin by lying on your right side, with your left foot on top of your right and your right forearm on the mat, elbow tucked under your shoulder.  
Your palm should be flat, your fingers spread, and your left hand should be on your hip. 
Lift hips and engage obliques till the body forms a straight line from head to heels.
Return to the beginning after a one-breath pause.
That counts as one rep. Finish 10 reps on the right side, then switch to the left side and finish 10 reps on that side. Proceed to the next step.



Reverse crunch
 

Begin by lying on your back with your arms at your sides and your legs lifted off the ground at a 45-degree angle with your toes pointing. 
Maintain core engagement by pressing down into arms and pulling knees into the chest until hips rise off the mat.
Return to the beginning slowly. 
That's a single rep. Do 10 repetitions. Go on to the next step.

 

Extended Arm Plank Bird Dog


Begin by holding a plank position. 
Engage your core and simultaneously lift your left arm and right leg off the mat, maintaining your hips as level as possible. 
Slowly return to the beginning. 
 

Rep the process on the other side. That counts as one rep. Perform 10 repetitions. Proceed to the next step.

 Russian twist

Sit on the floor with your upper body leaning back until your abs are fully engaged. 
Legs should be raised and bent at 90 degrees, and arms should be bent with hands clasped and elbows spread wide. 
This is the point from which you will begin your journey. 
Turn your torso to the right so that your right elbow is just off the mat.
Maintain a stable lower body while rotating your upper body to the left side until your left elbow is slightly off the surface. Return to the beginning. As you move, your gaze follows your hands. 

That counts as one rep. Perform 10 repetitions. Proceed to the next step.
